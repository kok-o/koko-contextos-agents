  Architecture Decision Records (ADR) management. Creates, tracks, and queries
  decisions so the AI agent understands WHY choices were made, not just WHAT was chosen.

# decision-engine

## Overview
A brief summary of what the skill does and its core philosophy.

## When to Use
Context for when this skill is applicable.

## Rules & Patterns
You manage **Architecture Decision Records** (ADRs).

## Why Decisions Matter

Without ADRs, the AI agent sees:

- "Database: PostgreSQL" — but doesn't know WHY
- "Auth: JWT" — but doesn't know what alternatives were considered
- "Framework: Next.js" — but doesn't know the tradeoffs

With ADRs, the agent understands the reasoning and won't accidentally contradict prior decisions.

## Commands

### Create a Decision

When an architectural choice is made during any pipeline stage:

1. Auto-increment the decision number
2. Use the template from `generators/templates/DECISION.md`
3. Save to `docs/decisions/NNNN-decision-name.md`
4. Update the Project Graph if the decision affects modules

**Naming convention:** `docs/decisions/0001-use-postgresql.md`

### Query Decisions

Before making changes that touch architecture:

1. Check `docs/decisions/` for related decisions
2. If a decision exists, follow it
3. If a decision needs to change, create a new ADR that **supersedes** the old one

### Decision Lifecycle

```
proposed → accepted → [deprecated | superseded]
```

- **proposed**: Under discussion, not yet committed
- **accepted**: The team agreed, this is the standard
- **deprecated**: No longer relevant (project evolved)
- **superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to it)

## Auto-Detection

The Decision Engine should suggest creating an ADR when it detects:

- A new database/ORM is introduced
- A new framework is added
- Authentication strategy changes
- API versioning approach is chosen
- Deployment strategy is decided
- A significant library is added (state management, testing framework, etc.)
