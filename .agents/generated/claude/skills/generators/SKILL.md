# document-generator

## Overview
A brief summary of what the skill does and its core philosophy.

## When to Use
Context for when this skill is applicable.

## Rules & Patterns
You generate project documentation from a user's idea. Use the templates in `templates/` as the structure for each document.

## Commands

### `ctx init`

Full project initialization. From one user prompt, generate ALL documents:

1. Ask clarifying questions (see Context OS SKILL.md)
2. Select profile and skill pack
3. Generate documents in this order:
   - `docs/PRD.md` — Product Requirements (from template)
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System Architecture
   - `docs/DATABASE.md` — Database Schema
   - `docs/API.md` — API Specification
   - `docs/UI.md` — UI/UX Specification
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Development Roadmap
   - `docs/TASKS.md` — Task Breakdown
   - `docs/PROJECT_GRAPH.md` — Project Graph
4. Create `docs/decisions/` directory for future ADRs
5. Generate agent config via Adapters skill

### `ctx update`

Incremental update. When requirements change:

1. Identify which documents are affected
2. Update only affected documents
3. Show diff of changes
4. Ask user to confirm
5. Update Project Graph if structure changed

### `ctx plan`

Generate development plan from existing PRD:

1. Read `docs/PRD.md`
2. Break into modules (Project Graph)
3. Break modules into features
4. Break features into tasks
5. Estimate complexity (S/M/L/XL)
6. Output to `docs/TASKS.md`

## Template Usage

Each template contains:

- **Section headers** — required sections for the document
- **Placeholder prompts** — `{{description}}` markers that guide content generation
- **Examples** — sample content to illustrate the expected format
- **Validation rules** — what must be present for the document to be valid

When generating a document:

1. Read the template
2. Fill in each section based on the user's idea and clarifying answers
3. Replace all `{{placeholders}}` with real content
4. Remove the template comments (lines starting with `<!-- -->`)
5. Validate: ensure all required sections are present

## Document Dependencies

```
PRD.md
  ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
  │     ├── DATABASE.md
  │     ├── API.md
  │     └── DEPLOYMENT.md
  ├── UI.md
  ├── ROADMAP.md
  │     └── TASKS.md
  └── PROJECT_GRAPH.md
```

When updating a parent document, check if child documents need updates too.
