# Microservices — Architecture Guide

## When to Use Microservices

**Use when:**
- Team > 10 engineers working on the same product
- Independent deployment of components is critical
- Different components have different scaling needs
- Different components need different tech stacks

**Don't use when:**
- Small team (< 5 engineers)
- MVP or prototype
- No operational expertise (monitoring, tracing, deployment)
- Tight coupling between components

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each service does ONE thing well.

### 2. Own Your Data
Each service has its own database. No shared databases.

### 3. API Contracts
Services communicate through well-defined APIs. Internal implementation is hidden.

### 4. Autonomous Deployment
Each service can be deployed independently.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (REST/gRPC)
- **When**: Request needs immediate response
- **Tools**: REST (HTTP), gRPC (high-performance)
- **Risk**: Cascading failures, latency accumulation

### Asynchronous (Events/Messages)
- **When**: Eventual consistency is acceptable
- **Tools**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, AWS SQS
- **Benefit**: Loose coupling, resilience

### Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)
```
Order Service → Payment Service → Inventory Service → Shipping Service
      ↓ (failure)
Compensating transactions reverse each step
```

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write models:
```
Command (Write) → Write Model → Event Store → Projections → Read Model → Query (Read)
```

**When**: Read patterns differ significantly from write patterns.

## Event Sourcing

Store events, not state:
```
UserCreated → EmailUpdated → RoleChanged → PasswordReset
```
Current state = replay all events. Full audit trail.

## Service Boundaries

### Bounded Contexts (from DDD)
- Identify domain boundaries
- Each service maps to a bounded context
- Shared language within the context, translation at boundaries

### Anti-Corruption Layer
When integrating with legacy or external systems, create an adapter that translates between models.

## Operational Concerns

### Observability (The Three Pillars)
1. **Logs** — structured JSON, correlated by request ID
2. **Metrics** — latency, error rate, throughput (RED)
3. **Traces** — distributed tracing across services (Jaeger, Zipkin)

### Resilience
- **Circuit Breaker** — stop calling failing services
- **Retry with Backoff** — exponential backoff + jitter
- **Timeout** — every call has a timeout
- **Bulkhead** — isolate failures

### Deployment
- **Containers** — Docker for consistency
- **Orchestration** — Kubernetes for production
- **CI/CD** — independent pipelines per service
- **Blue-Green / Canary** — safe rollouts

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Distributed monolith — services that can't deploy independently
- ❌ Shared database — defeats the purpose
- ❌ Synchronous chains — A calls B calls C calls D
- ❌ No versioning — breaking API changes
- ❌ Premature microservices — start with a modular monolith
