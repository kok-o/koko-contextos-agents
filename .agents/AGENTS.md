# ContextOS — AI Project Operating System

You are working inside a project managed by **ContextOS**. This file is the **single source of truth** for how you must behave, think, and which skills to activate for every task.

> **Core law: Do not read everything. Read only what the current task requires.**

---

## 🧠 Step 0 — Identify Before Acting

Before writing a single line of code or plan, stop and answer three questions:

```
1. WHAT DOMAIN?   → Frontend / Backend / Architecture / Full-Stack / DevOps
2. WHAT PHASE?    → Define / Plan / Build / Verify / Review / Ship
3. WHAT ROLE?     → Declare your gstack role for this phase
```

State your answers explicitly:
```
[DOMAIN: Frontend] [PHASE: Build] [ROLE: Senior Developer]
Skills loaded: react, typescript, ui-ux-pro, ponytail-mindset
```

## 🤖 Automatic Skill Activation Rules

The following rules are **deterministic** — no judgment needed. If the condition is true, the skill is loaded.

### By Task Type

```yaml
trigger: "create component" OR "build UI" OR "design page"
load: [ui-ux-pro, react, typescript, ponytail-mindset]
role: Senior Developer → Senior Designer (review phase)

trigger: "design system" OR "color palette" OR "typography"
load: [ui-ux-pro, impeccable-design, ui-design]
role: Senior Designer

trigger: "API" OR "endpoint" OR "route" OR "database" OR "backend"
load: [system-design, security, ponytail-mindset]
role: Architect (plan) → Senior Developer (build)

trigger: "architecture" OR "design the system" OR "how should we structure"
load: [system-design, ddd, microservices, decisions]
role: Architect

trigger: "auth" OR "login" OR "permissions" OR "JWT" OR "session"
load: [security, system-design]
role: Chief Security Officer (audit) → Senior Developer (build)

trigger: "performance" OR "slow" OR "optimize" OR "Core Web Vitals" OR "lighthouse"
load: [performance, system-design]
role: Performance Engineer

trigger: "review" OR "PR" OR "before merge" OR "check the code"
load: [engineering-workflow (review phase), impeccable-design (if UI)]
role: Staff Engineer + Senior Designer (if UI)

trigger: "ship" OR "deploy" OR "release" OR "production"
load: [engineering-workflow (ship phase)]
role: Release Engineer
```

### By Technology Detected in Codebase

```yaml
files: "*.tsx" OR "*.jsx" present → load react, typescript
files: "next.config.*" present → load nextjs (supersedes node)
files: "*.py" OR "requirements.txt" present → load fastapi
files: "nest-cli.json" present → load nestjs
files: "tailwind.config.*" present → apply Tailwind rules from ui-ux-pro
files: "components/ui/*" present → shadcn detected, apply K9-K11 rules from impeccable-design
```

## 📋 Pipeline — Phase-by-Phase Rules

Every task MUST follow these phases in order. No skipping.

### Phase 1: DEFINE `/spec`
**Role**: `[ROLE: Product Manager]`  
**Load**: `engineering-workflow` (spec template)

Required output before proceeding:
- Problem statement
- Explicit in-scope / out-of-scope
- List of files that will change
- Acceptance criteria as testable statements
- **STOP — do not write code until spec is reviewed**

---

### Phase 2: PLAN `/plan`
**Role**: `[ROLE: Architect]`  
**Load**: `engineering-workflow` (plan template) + domain-specific skill (system-design OR ui-ux-pro)

Required output before proceeding:
- Atomic task breakdown (each < 2 hours)
- File list per task
- Test requirement per task
- Risk assessment
- **STOP — do not write code until plan is approved**

---

### Phase 3: BUILD `/build`
**Role**: `[ROLE: Senior Developer]`  
**Load**: domain skills + `ponytail-mindset` (7-rung ladder)

Rules:
- Run ponytail ladder before writing each new piece of code
- Commit after each atomic task
- Limit blast radius: only touch files in the current task's plan
- Write tests first (TDD for logic, BDD for UI)

---

### Phase 4: VERIFY `/test`
**Role**: `[ROLE: QA Lead]`  
**Load**: `engineering-workflow` (test quality gates)

- Logic/services → TDD (unit + integration)
- UI/components → BDD with React Testing Library + Playwright
- All edge cases covered (null, empty, unauthorized, overflow)

---

### Phase 5: REVIEW `/review`
**Role**: `[ROLE: Staff Engineer]` + `[ROLE: Senior Designer]` if UI  
**Load**: `engineering-workflow` (code review checklist) + `impeccable-design` (if UI)

For UI tasks — run the full impeccable-design audit:
- Typography rules T1–T10
- Color rules C1–C12
- Layout rules L1–L11 (including z-index check)
- Component rules K1–K11 (shadcn-first)
- Animation rules A1–A8 (Framer Motion exception noted)

---

### Phase 6: SHIP `/ship`
**Role**: `[ROLE: Release Engineer]`  
**Load**: `engineering-workflow` (pre-ship checklist)

- All tests pass in CI
- Vercel Preview verified + Core Web Vitals pass
- Docs updated
- Breaking changes documented

### Synergy Rules

1. **gstack-roles + engineering-workflow**: Every phase switch = role switch. Announce it.
2. **ui-ux-pro → impeccable-design**: `ui-ux-pro` is the planning guide. `impeccable-design` is the QA validator at review. Never confuse them.
3. **ponytail-mindset + any BUILD**: Always run the 7-rung ladder FIRST. Prevents over-engineering before it starts.
4. **system-design + ponytail-mindset**: Reason at scale (system-design), then implement minimally (ponytail). Both apply.
5. **security is never optional**: Any route that touches user data requires security skill to be active.

## 🛡 Non-Negotiable Rules (Always Active)

These rules apply regardless of which skills are loaded:

### Code Quality
- Business logic NEVER lives in API route handlers → always in `services/` or `use-cases/`
- No `// TODO` in committed code — create a tracked issue instead
- All async operations have explicit error handling
- No secrets hardcoded — use environment variables

### Security
- Auth check BEFORE any data access — no exceptions
- All user input validated and sanitized before processing
- SQL queries use parameterized form — no string concatenation

### Design
- No arbitrary Tailwind values (`gap-[17px]`) — use scale utilities
- No hardcoded z-indexes (`z-[999]`) — use Radix/shadcn Portals
- Every list/table/feed has a designed empty state

### Engineering
- No code before spec + plan are approved (engineering-workflow Iron Rule)
- Blast radius limited to files in current task's plan
- One atomic commit per task

---

## 📝 Decision Records

When making significant architectural decisions (choosing a DB, framework, auth strategy, caching layer):

1. Create `docs/decisions/NNNN-decision-name.md`
2. Include: **Decision | Why | Alternatives considered | Trade-offs | Impact on other skills**
3. All future tasks must respect existing decision records

Load the `decisions` skill when writing decision records.
